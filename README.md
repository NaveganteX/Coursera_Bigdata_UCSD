# Big Data Specialization - UCSD


Cousera online course, [Big Data specilization][Big Data specilization], created 
by University of California, San Diego, taught by _Ilkay Altintas_(Chief Data 
Science Officer), _Amarnath Gupta_(Director, Advanced Query Processing Lab) and 
_Mai Nguyen_(Lead for Data Analytics), they all work in San Diego Supercomputer 
Center(SDSC) .

	During this Specialization I was trying to understand big data and how it will impact business, try to gain an understanding of what insights big data can provide through hands-on 
experience with the tools and systems used by big data scientists and engineers.Try to be guided through the basics of using Hadoop with Map-reduce, Spark,
Pig and Hive. By following along with provided code, try to get experience how one can perform predictive modeling and leverage graph analytics to model problems.
This specialization will prepare me to ask the right questions about data, communicate effectively with data scientists, and do basic exploration of large,
complex data-sets. In the final Capstone Project, developed in partnership with data software company Splunk, i'll apply the skills i learned to do basic
analyses of big data.
